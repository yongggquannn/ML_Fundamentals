Machine Learning from Scratch... Hopefully this gets me somewhere to become a better Machine Learning Developer. 

Mainly covering the implementation of KNN, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), Perceptron, SVM (Support Vectore Machine) & K-Means using Python.
